    <StyledP color='gold'>ðŸ˜„ Still useful for web even with CSS animations. And allows nesting. And animations (Transforms (scale, rotation, translation, and skew) & opacity) will eat GPU resources leaving processors alone. JS can get GPU benefits when using translate3D() or matrix3D() by the way.</StyledP>
    <StyledP color='gold'>ðŸ˜„ Simple static pages with no animations can use SC Native lib and have one code for both platforms. Quite high performance delivery (ðŸ™ƒ) for MVP's.</StyledP>
    <StyledP color='maroon'>ðŸ˜¤ With high number of similar objects warns to go through css-object approach instead template literals. Have not measured it but may performance problems?</StyledP>
