    <StyledP color='gold'>ðŸ˜„ Still useful for web even with CSS animations. And allows nesting. And animations will eat GPU resources leaving processors alone.</StyledP>
    <StyledP color='gold'>ðŸ˜„ Simple static pages with no animations can use SC Native lib and have one code for both platforms. Quite high performance delivery (ðŸ™ƒ) for MVP's.</StyledP>
    <StyledP color='maroon'>ðŸ˜¤ With high number of similar objects warns to go through css-object approach instead template literals. Have not measured it but may performance problems?</StyledP>
